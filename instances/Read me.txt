This folder contains three datasets used in the study:

1- Boccia's Instances:
The original dataset proposed by Boccia et al. (2023), including 1080 instances with the following characteristics:

-Number of jobs: 50, 100, 150, 200

-Number of AGVs: 2, 5, 10

-Various transportation times and energy consumption settings

2- New Large-Scale Instances:
A set of 30 newly generated instances, following the structure of Boccia et al. (2023), but designed for larger settings:

-300 jobs

-20 AGVs

3-Case Study:
A modified version of the case study by Kabir and Suzuki (2019), adapted to a layout with:

-200 jobs

-Up to 10 AGVs

For more information, please refer to the corresponding subfolders.
