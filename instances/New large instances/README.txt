Each instance file follows the naming format:

Ins_V20_J300_T30_R60_B10_W<W> (i)

Where W<W> and (i) represent:

W<W>: Average energy consumption per job
(W1, W2, or W4 for low, medium, and high energy usage)

(i): Index of the random instance for the given configuration
(Values from 1 to 10)

Example:
Ins_V20_J300_T30_R60_B10_W1 (1)

20 AGVs

300 jobs

Avg. transportation time = 30

Battery capacity = 10

Recharging time = 60

Avg. energy consumption = 1

First random instance of this configuration
