	-Main algorithm.py: 
 This is the main script that runs the designed single-tree search Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) algorithm.
 
 	-Class_STSLBBD.py and Class_STSLBBD_Just_FCF.py
These files define two LBBD variants:

-Class_STSLBBD.py: Implements the LBBD(CBPP) variant, which uses a subproblem formulation based on CBPP and applies corresponding cuts.

-Class_STSLBBD_Just_FCF.py: Implements the LBBD(FCF) variant, which uses a simplified subproblem and cut generation based only on FCF.

	-Other auxiliary Python files are used throughout the algorithm and support various functionalities such as model construction, data handling, or utility operations.
